# Phone Controller

## What is it

A React web app that allows you to control your computer (mouse and keyboard) from your phone

## How it works

The app uses sockets to establish a real time connection from your phone/client to the server running on your computer. Dragging you finger accross the screen moves the mouse, and bring down the keyboard on the app lets you type on your computer as well.

## Installation

To install it's dependencies:

$npm install

Then to start the app:

$npm start

A url will show on console -- put this url into your mobile browser and you can
now control your PC from here.

## Future Features

- Add volume control buttons on the UI
- Add programmable "shortcut" buttons that do a specific task (like open Netflix)
